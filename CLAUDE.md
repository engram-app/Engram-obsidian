Obsidian plugin for bidirectional sync with Engram, distributed as "Engram Vault Sync" (plugin id `engram-vault-sync`). One half of the Engram project — backend repo is `engram-app/engram`, plugin repo is `engram-app/Engram-obsidian` (local dir name stayed `engram-obsidian-sync` after rename).

## Superpowers spec docs → Engram vault (overrides the skill default)

When `superpowers:brainstorming` produces a design/spec doc, save it to the **Engram vault** at `50 Engineering/_Superpowers Specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` via the engram MCP (`set_vault` → Engram `4c2057f9-a6cb-4e5e-9b4e-7ac50fb77c35`, `create_note`/`write_note`, then `set_vault()` to reset) — **not** to `docs/superpowers/specs/`. Specs are durable design rationale, so they live in the vault (searchable, dogfoods engram). This user instruction takes precedence over the skill's local-save step.

**Plans stay repo-local.** `superpowers:writing-plans` output is an ephemeral implementation checklist — keep it in `docs/superpowers/plans/` as the skill specifies; do not route plans to the vault.

## Issue Tracker

TODOs and open issues live in GitHub Issues for this repo — `gh issue list` to view, `gh issue create` to file. Don't track work in CLAUDE.md, docs/, or ad-hoc TODO.md files.

> **Multi-repo project.** This plugin is one half of Engram. For cross-project work (API changes, debugging plugin↔backend, deploy), open `../engram-workspace/` instead. See `../engram-workspace/docs/workspace-pattern.md` for when to use what.

See "Context Docs" below for the full doc-pointer index (plugin internals, ops, cross-repo, Obsidian API, sync/CRDT architecture, scripts).

## What This Plugin Does

A TypeScript sync client. It does NOT parse markdown, generate embeddings, or talk to Qdrant — Engram handles all of that. The plugin just pushes/pulls notes via REST.

### Responsibilities

1. **Watch vault events** — `app.vault.on("create")`, `on("modify")`, `on("delete")`, `on("rename")`
2. **Push changes to Engram** — `POST /api/notes` with file content + metadata
3. **Pull changes from Engram** — `GET /api/notes/changes` on startup and periodically (plus authoritative inventory via `GET /api/sync/manifest`)
4. **Write remote changes to vault** — files created/edited via MCP, the web SPA editor, or other devices
5. **Settings panel + Sync Center** — Engram URL, API key, ignore patterns, conflict resolution, sync preview, push/pull-all flows

### Does NOT

- Parse markdown or chunk text (Engram does this)
- Generate embeddings (Engram does this — Voyage AI on SaaS; Ollama is self-host only)
- Talk to Qdrant (Engram does this)
- Perform search indexing (Engram does this — plugin provides the search UI via `POST /api/search`)
- Manage auth/users (Engram does this)

## Git Workflow

**Everything goes through a PR. No exceptions, no admin bypass, no "doc-only" shortcuts that stretch into code.**

`main` is protected with `enforce_admins=true`. Required status checks (`build-and-test`, `version-check`, `backend/e2e`) must pass before merge. Stable releases are cut by merging the release-please PR into `main`: direct pushes skip the Release PR and break the release flow.

Workflow for any change, including doc updates:

1. `git switch -c <type>/<slug>` — `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`.
2. Commit on the branch. Conventional Commits, ≤50-char subject.
3. `git push -u origin <branch>` and open a PR with `gh pr create`.
4. Let CI run. If anything fails, fix it on the branch, never on main.
5. Merge through GitHub (`gh pr merge --squash` or the web UI). **Do not push directly to main, even to "fix the test" or "ship a doc tweak".**

The previous "doc-only changes can land on main" carve-out is rescinded — it drifted into code commits and bypassed the test gate that caught the missing README disclosure.

**Worktrees**: `git worktree add` fires a `post-checkout` hook (wired via `lefthook.yml`) that hardlinks `node_modules/` from the canonical checkout into the new tree — first build / lint runs without re-fetching ~500MB of deps. Just `git worktree add <path> -b <branch> origin/main`, no `bun install` needed on the fresh tree unless `mix.lock`/`bun.lock` is being edited.

## Testing

**Tests are the spec. If a test fails, fix the app — not the test.**

```bash
bun test              # Run the full unit-test suite
bun test --verbose    # Verbose output
bun test --coverage   # With coverage report
bun run build         # Build the plugin (production)
```

### Test files

Don't hardcode test counts here — they drift. Run `bun test` for the live total,
and `ls tests/*.test.ts` for the current file list. Coverage roughly tracks
~89% funcs / ~97% lines but check `bun test --coverage` for the real number.

Broad areas under test: SyncEngine (ignore/modify/delete/rename, pull, cursor-pull,
WebSocket events, echo suppression, 3-way merge, state export/import), the cursor
+ manifest reconciliation path, the offline queue, the API client (incl. batch
push + `/sync/changes`), auth (ApiKey + OAuth device flow), the Phoenix channel,
diff/merge, remote logging, plan/limit state, and a set of compliance tests
(manifest, license, README disclosures, source/styles hygiene, command IDs).

### Test configuration

- **Bun test config:** `bunfig.toml` — preloads `tests/preload.ts` for Obsidian module mocks
- **Obsidian mock:** `tests/__mocks__/obsidian.ts` — minimal mocks for TFile, Plugin, Modal, requestUrl, etc.
- **Coverage thresholds:** 40% minimum for branches, functions, lines, statements

### Untested files (UI-heavy — test via E2E in backend repo)

`settings.ts`, `conflict-modal.ts`, `search-modal.ts`, `search-view.ts`, `main.ts`

## Package Manager

**Use `bun`, not `npm`.** All commands (`install`, `test`, `build`, `run`, `lint`, `audit`) must use `bun`.

`package-lock.json` is not tracked. `bun.lock` must stay portable: never regenerate it with a `registry=` set in `~/.npmrc` or bun bakes that host into every entry, which breaks outside contributors and the Obsidian community scanner. `scripts/check-lockfile-registry.mjs` (lefthook + CI) enforces it; see `docs/context/scanner-type-resolution.md`.

## Build & Install

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

**Before opening a PR** run the CI-only lints locally (they only run in CI, so a miss = a red round-trip): `bun test`, `./node_modules/.bin/biome ci` (NOT `check`, and not `bunx biome` — wrong version), `bun run lint:obsidian`, `bun run lint:css`, `bun run build`.

## Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. Tags use `x.y.z` format (no `v` prefix) for BRAT/Obsidian compatibility.

**Do NOT bump `manifest.json` in feature PRs.** Versions are auto-derived (beta/per-PR). Stable releases are cut by merging the release-please PR.

### CI Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `ci.yml` | Push to any branch | Build, lint, test + trigger backend E2E |
| `version-check.yml` | PR to main | Enforces `manifest.json`/`package.json`/`versions.json` consistency, but only when `manifest.json` is deliberately bumped; otherwise a no-op pass |
| `pr-build.yml` | PR to main (each push) | Publishes a prerelease tagged `X.Y.Z-pr.<num>.<sha>` with build assets, for BRAT frozen-version install by reviewers |
| `release-please.yml` | Push to main | Maintains a standing "Release PR"; on merge, bumps `manifest.json`/`package.json`, cuts the version, creates the release + bare `X.Y.Z` tag, then (gated on its own `release_created` output) builds, attests, and uploads `main.js`/`manifest.json`/`styles.css` to that release, updates `versions.json`, and posts the Discord announce |

There's also a rolling **beta** channel (`main` builds published as `X.Y.Z-beta.N`, installed via BRAT's "add beta plugin") that's part of this same release-channels initiative; its workflow lands in a separate commit.

### Cutting a release

1. **Open/merge feature PRs as usual.** Each push to a PR auto-publishes a per-PR prerelease via `pr-build.yml` (see above); no version bump needed.
2. **Edit the release notes.** `release-please.yml` keeps a Release PR up to date with a generated CHANGELOG; edit that PR's description to adjust the notes.
3. **Merge the release-please PR.** This bumps `manifest.json`/`package.json`, cuts the version, and publishes the stable GitHub release directly (build assets, `versions.json`, and the Discord announce), all from the same `release-please.yml` run. There is no separate tag-triggered workflow.

### Deploy to Local Vault

```bash
bun run build
cp main.js manifest.json styles.css "/home/open-claw/Obsidian Vault/.obsidian/plugins/engram-vault-sync/"
```

Restart Obsidian or disable/re-enable the plugin to pick up changes.

### Branch Protection (GitHub Settings)

Required status checks on `main`: `build-and-test`, `version-check / version-check`

- Notes land EMPTY during a first sync and fill in a pass later, or you are about to treat a 0-byte file as "nothing to protect" (three ways an empty file lies: a converged clear, undelivered ops, a `cachedRead` that invented it) → `docs/context/crdt-empty-placeholder-cold-rooms.md`
- Wondering why a catch-up leg records no `serverHash`/`seq`, or tempted to add one (a row can lag its own `content_hash`; recording it marks the note in sync at bytes you cannot verify and every later row compares equal and is skipped) → `docs/context/crdt-empty-placeholder-cold-rooms.md`
