/**
 * upgrade-required.ts — the client half of the backend's minimum-plugin-version
 * floor.
 *
 * The server refuses a plugin older than its floor: HTTP `426` on REST, and a
 * `plugin_upgrade_required` reason on a channel join. Both are terminal —
 * retrying cannot clear them and every transport is refused at once — so the
 * user has to be told, or they watch sync fail forever with no explanation.
 *
 * ## Why the server's `update_url` is ignored
 *
 * The 426 body carries one, and this module deliberately does not read it.
 * `api.ts`'s `sanitizeUpgradeUrl` already refuses any non-http(s) URL from a
 * 402 body precisely because a malicious self-host backend must not be able to
 * launch arbitrary protocol handlers — and the natural update target here IS a
 * non-http scheme (`obsidian://`). Rather than carve an exception into that
 * rule, the action is supplied locally by `main.ts` via `setUpgradeAction`.
 * The server field stays useful to other clients; this one never trusts it.
 *
 * ## Once per session
 *
 * Every refused request and every reconnect would otherwise toast. The latch
 * clears only on plugin reload, which is also when a freshly-installed version
 * would take effect.
 *
 * ponytail: does NOT stop sync. The server already refuses everything, so a
 * local kill switch would only duplicate that at the cost of a second piece of
 * state to get wrong. Add one if the reconnect traffic ever shows up as load.
 *
 * What that actually looks like on the wire, since "does not stop sync" sounds
 * busier than it is: Phoenix does not close a socket on a join error, so a
 * refused client keeps ONE open socket. `sync:` and `crdt:` are refused,
 * `user:` still joins (no version gate on `check_not_deleted/1`), and the 30s
 * heartbeat keeps the connection alive — so `onclose` never fires and the
 * `crdtJoinFailedReason` backoff in `channel.ts` is never reached. The client
 * idles with `connected === false` rather than retry-storming. Nothing watches
 * that flag today.
